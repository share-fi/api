# wirefy
The social network that keeps on giving.

Have you ever needed WiFi but don't have the password?

## Development

You'll need the `bundle` gem installed on your machine, as well as ruby.
Clone the repo, install dependencies, then run the main app.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wirefy/wirefy

cd wirefy && bundle install
ruby app.rb # Browse to localhost:4567
```

Here's the Google Maps API Key, because fuck it, we're not going to set the rest of it up because people at CodeDay always make that promise, you know, "You guys wanna work on this project after CodeDay?", and everyone nods their head, pretending this is more than a one night stand project thrown together with Red Bull and confusion. Nobody continues a one night stand hackathon project post hackathon. Nobody.
